# FileSharing
I shell program for quick and easy file-sharing within the same network. Simply select a file, and an HTTP server with the file will be opened. Additionally, a QR code will be generated for easy download on mobile devices.

## Download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stachu1/FileSharing.git
```

## Usage
```bash
python FileSharing.py <file>
```

**Please don't use it for any confidential files, as anyone on the same network will be able to access them.**
